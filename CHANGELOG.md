## [0.5.0] - 2024-11-30

Thanks to @JSensebe for his contributions!

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** Rename `SensorInterface` to `SensorDriver`.
- **BREAKING:** Rename `GeneratorSensorInterface` to `IterableSensorDriver`
  and some accompanying type aliases.
- **BREAKING:** Decouple `SensorDriver` and `InputDriver` so that
  the former is no longer part of the latter.
- Use `InputDriver.max_users` to filter sensor input
  regardless of the underlying sensor driver.

### Added

- Add `SensorDriver.poll`.
- Add `SessionBuilder.with_sensor`.
- Add `Session.set_controller_port_device`.

- Improved documentation for `IterableSensorDriver`.
- Fix a `GET_VARIABLE` dereference error.

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** Rename `RumbleInterface` to `RumbleDriver`.
- **BREAKING:** Rename `DefaultRumbleDriver` to `DictRumbleDriver`.
- **BREAKING:** Rename `GeneratorInputDriver` to `IterableInputDriver`.

### Fixed

- Fix the rumble driver raising an exception when setting the rumble state.

## [0.3.1] - 2024-10-17

### Changed

- Updated moderngl to 5.12.

### Fixed

- Prevented unhandled OpenGL errors in cores from
  cascading into the frontend as exceptions
  raised from `moderngl` or PyOpenGL.

## [0.3.0] - 2024-09-25

- Improved documentation for parts of `SessionBuilder` and `VideoDriver`
- Removed a `glClear` call in `ModernGlVideoDriver` that was left in by accident.
- Clear the `glGetError` queue at various places in `ModernGlVideoDriver`
  to prevent PyOpenGL from misreporting errors that came from moderngl or the loaded core.

- **BREAKING:** Remove `VideoDriverInitArgs`.

## [0.2.0] - 2024-09-12

  ([#11](https://github.com/JesseTG/libretro.py/issues/11))
- Allow `ArrayVideoDriver.screenshot()` to rotate the returned frame
  ([#3](https://github.com/JesseTG/libretro.py/issues/3))
- Add 16-bit pixel format support to `ArrayVideoDriver.screenshot()`.

- **BREAKING:** Rename `KeyboardState.break_` to `KeyboardState.break_key`

### Fixed

- Fix `Core.unserialize` being unable to accept `bytes` objects.
  ([#4](https://github.com/JesseTG/libretro.py/issues/4))
- Fix an exception when a core sets its geometry before its initial AV info is fetched.
  ([#6](https://github.com/JesseTG/libretro.py/issues/6))
- Fix a crash when a core uses `retro_led_interface`.
  ([#7](https://github.com/JesseTG/libretro.py/issues/7))
- Fix an exception when passing a frame pitch inconsistent with the configured video format.
  ([#8](https://github.com/JesseTG/libretro.py/issues/8))

  to ensure compatibility with Python 3.11.

## [0.1.5] - 2024-06-03

- Allow `ModernGlVideoDriver`'s import of PyOpenGL
  to fail with an `AttributeError`.

## [0.1.4] - 2024-06-03

## [0.1.2] - 2024-05-31

### Fixed

- Fixed the GLSL shaders used by `ModernGlVideoDriver` not being included in distributions.

## [0.1.1] - 2024-05-31

### Fixed

- Swap the red and blue channels in `ArrayVideoDriver`.
- Immediately reinitialize the video driver when a core calls
  `RETRO_ENVIRONMENT_SET_SYSTEM_AV_INFO`, as the docs specify.

## [0.0.1] - 2024-04-22

### Changed

- Allow the callbacks in `Core` to accept `Callable`s with equivalent signatures,
  rather than strictly enforcing the use of the `retro_*` `CFUNCTYPE`s.
- Allow `Core.cheat_set` to accept a `str` as the cheat code.
- **BREAKING**: Don't allow the cheat code passed to `Core.cheat_set`
  to be a `memoryview` or `Buffer`,
  as these don't typically represent strings.

## [0.0.0] - 2024-04-11

### Added

- Everything.
